Hello World!

My name is Kevin, and I am from Utah!  I am currently a student attending Utah Valley University, majoring in Computeer Science.  I also have a passion for music.  I play the cello and love to compose symphonic music.  I'm trying to gain experience and improve my programming skills.  Thanks!
